CLM is a framework for collection of data where the data is owned by the community. The community in this case are PLHIV (People Living with HIV) patients who were interviewed at various facilities in Kenya to obtain their thoughts and opinions on the service delivery. Service delivery is crucial, and can sway the outcome of the patient's health, therefore, should be treated with the utmost care.\n","\n","The project focuses on predicting patient satisfaction for HIV healthcare services by analyzing several factors like service availability, quality of care, confidentiality, facility accessibility, and patient demographics. The goal is to enhance the quality of care for HIV patients. The predictive model will help identify improvement areas, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient satisfaction and health outcomes. \n","\n","The dataset consists of approximately 36,000 patient responses from healthcare facility surveys, including demographic details, healthcare experiences, and service delivery satisfaction levels. The objective is to use machine learning to predict satisfaction, determine key satisfaction drivers, and guide healthcare providers in resource allocation for service delivery improvements.\n","\n","##### About the app\n","\n","This app pre-processes the survey data and applies a machine learning algorithm to predict if the patient is satisfied with the services or not. The outputs of the predictive model can be used in enhancing the decision making process of improving service delivery and thus, satisfying the patient."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["##### Import the dependencies and the data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"cell_id":"b28bf77ed58b498eb81ba7a2a68201e3","deepnote_app_block_visible":true,"deepnote_app_is_code_hidden":true,"deepnote_app_is_output_hidden":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":1427,"execution_start":1712134460323,"source_hash":null},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import regex as re\n","from scipy.stats import randint, uniform\n","import joblib\n","\n","import plotly.express as px\n","import plotly.graph_objs as go\n","import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n","\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.svm import SVC\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, label_binarize\n","from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score, precision_recall_curve, roc_curve, auc, average_precision_score, confusion_matrix\n","\n","from catboost import CatBoostClassifier\n","from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\n","from xgboost import XGBClassifier"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"cell_id":"99782251e39a494184918fe8f73efc75","deepnote_app_block_visible":true,"deepnote_app_is_code_hidden":true,"deepnote_app_is_output_hidden":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":2020,"execution_start":1712134461782,"source_hash":null},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["C:\\Users\\mogam\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_14856\\2747984450.py:1: DtypeWarning: Columns (3,8,10,14,22,23,39,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81) have mixed types.
